# Events Module

In general, this module is for helping users (service providers and consumers) to plan and execute events pertaining to their business activities.

In particular, for the chama application, it is for helping its group members manage their events in a systematic way.

For this version, chama application's emphasis is on planning. We will focus on:- 

    1. Capture events planned by the group, od hoc events & those that occur on a regular basis.

    2. Communicate to users when events occur. 

    3 Maintain proper accounting books for all contributions made by members.
